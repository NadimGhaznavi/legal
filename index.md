title: Support Recalculation – October 2016 to May 2019
---

---

Hailey moved out of Tara Evans’ residence in October 2016.

She began attending Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia in September 2017 and 
remained in Nova Scotia for the 2017/18 academic year and part of 2018/19.

Tara Evans reported to the Family Responsibility Office that Hailey continued
to reside with her until May 1, 2019 and remained enrolled in school during 
that time.

Support enforcement continued on the basis of that representation.

That representation is false.

# Impact of the Alleged Arrears

- Credit rating significantly impaired.
- Employment opportunities requiring credit checks unavailable.
- Enforcement actions recorded.
- Financial loss from overpayment.

---

# Adjustment and Reimbursement of Overpayment

I am seeking:

- Recalculation of support for October 2016 – May 2019.
- Elimination of improperly calculated arrears.
- Recovery of overpayments.
- Interest where applicable.
- Enforcement mechanism sufficient to ensure recovery.
