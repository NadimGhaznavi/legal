Spoke with a lawyer:

The lawyer was awful, bordering on abusive:

- The lawyer would not listen
- They berated me for being unemployed
- They suggested that I was a dead beat Dad

The did advise me that:

- I needed to pull together:
  - All of the tax returns
  - Statement of the account from FRO

- I could attempt to resolve this outside of court with an ADIOS form
  - That's not correct, support was already discontinued
