# Call Notes

- Nancy, the FRO case officer, advised me that Tara is claiming:
  - Madeline was living at home and in school until her (Madeline's) birthday: **Oct 2, 2018**
  - Hailey was living at home and in school until: **May 1, 2019**
  
- Nancy said that it doesn't matter that I faxed in Hailey's Dalhousie transcaript for 2017/2018 and her 2018/2019 enrollment. I need to go back to court.
